1.innerHTML: returns  text node as well as html nodes
2.textContent : returns all text content
3.innerText : gives the text in the selected node
4.querySelector
5.querySelectorAll
6.getAttribute
7.setAttribute

innerText vs textContent
NOTE: innerText will only show what is visible on the page. Meanwhile,
textContent will show all the texts even if it's hidden due to any CSS property being applied to the text.

querySelectorAll returns nodeList which allows us to use forEach loop on it and and 
other selectors like getElementsByClassName, getElementsByName return
HTMLCollection which does not allow us to use forEach loop on it.


So by using Array.from(variable_name)  method on HTMLCollection and nodeList we can covert them into array and
we can perform all array methods then.
